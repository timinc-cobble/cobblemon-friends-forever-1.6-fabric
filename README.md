## About

Friends Forever adds a new way to add Pokémon to your team in Cobblemon. Feed Pokémon - both wild and not - in order to
increase their affection toward you. If they’re wild, they may join your team!

## Testing

Simply grab a stack of apples and start ramming it down the nearest wild Pokémon’s gullet. The game will tell you
whether the Pokémon liked that food or not, and every time you feed, they may join your team. Using them being
neutral towards the food as a baseline, around 32 pieces should guarantee they join your team with the base config.

## Applications

Give players the opportunity to bribe a Pokémon they come across with food if they’ve run out of PokeBalls. Remove the
recipes for PokeBalls altogether to shift the game from battling-to-capture to feeding-to-capture.
